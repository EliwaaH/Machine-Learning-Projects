# Churn-Prediction
Here in Churn prediction project, I am using a csutomers dataset downloaded from kaggle to predict which customer do the company have to send a promotion mail to keep him and try to convince him not to churn by using some deals and discounts, I have used sklearn library to train a logistic regerssion model and try to find the most important features to my model and target prediction.
